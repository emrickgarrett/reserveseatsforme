=================

Project created for RevolutionUC by Garrett Emrick from Miami University.

It was a project I did for fun in about 36 hours off and on. Code is definitely not the greatest but I got some cool experience using D3.js to create an interactive application to create floor layouts/reserve seats! Was my first time really doing anything Javascript heavy.
